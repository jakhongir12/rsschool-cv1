## Code example:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
```
function solution(number){

  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```
